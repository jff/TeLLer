# TeLLer v0.1.9

TeLLer is an interactive linear logic prover and proof explorer that is currently being used to
study causality in interactive story telling.

TeLLer started being developed by Andy Kitchen (see https://github.com/andykitchen/linear-logic).
It was further extended by João F. Ferreira to support focusing granularity and to generate causality
graphs.
